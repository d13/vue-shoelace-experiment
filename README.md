# Vue + Shoelace Experiment

This was an experiment to learn about the Composition API in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) as well as pairing [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) with [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/).

## Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Run the build first to copy the icon assets to the public directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
